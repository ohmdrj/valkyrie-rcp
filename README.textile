h1. Valkyrie RCP (zerem's fork)

"Sources":https://github.com/zerem/Valkyrie-RCP

h2. Introduction
 
Valkyrie-RCP's mission is to provide an elegant way to build highly-configurable, GUI-standards-following rich-client applications faster by leveraging the Spring Framework, and a rich library of UI factories and support classes.

See "Valkyrie-RCP Origin":https://github.com/cmadsen/Valkyrie-RCP

Zerem's fork extends framework with module called AX (Another eXtension), with same goal as Valkyrie-RCP. The naming AX was chosen for lack of creativity (obviously) and for marking end-user classes... but gone hellishly wrong.

h2. Disclamer

Original autor of this framework is "lievendoclo":http://twitter.com/lievendoclo. This fork is from contributor "cmadsen":https://github.com/cmadsen.

This project is still Work-In-Progress, so API is expected to change heavily during development. Also I have to remove usage of own proprietary API.

h2. What's new?

* Initial import of AX module

h2. What's due?

* Remove proprietary API (uncompilable sources)

h2. Usage

dependencies {
        compile group: 'dk.navicon', name:'valkyrie-rcp-core', version:'1.1'
}
